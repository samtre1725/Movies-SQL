# Movies-SQL





Window Functions:

1.This query calculates the average rating of each movie genre using window functions. It also ranks the movies within each genre based on their ratings.
Subqueries:

2.Here, a subquery is used to filter movies with ratings higher than the average rating of their respective genres. It selects the title, genre, and rating of such movies.
CTE (Common Table Expressions):

3.This query utilizes a Common Table Expression (CTE) to calculate the cumulative rating of movies within each genre. The cumulative rating is the sum of ratings of all movies in a genre, ordered by their titles.
Pivoting:

4.In this query, pivoting is used to calculate the average rating of movies for each genre. The result is a table where each genre corresponds to its average rating.
Recursive Queries:

5.This query employs a recursive common table expression (CTE) to find all subgenres under the main genre "Action". It recursively searches through the genre hierarchy table to retrieve all subgenres.
Each query demonstrates different SQL techniques such as window functions, subqueries, CTEs, pivoting, and recursive queries to showcase various skills and capabilities in SQL querying.
